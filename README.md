# ae-plcg
This project is a Python3 implementation of Probabilistic Left Corner Grammars (PLCGs; Manning and Carpenter, 1997) including Arc-Eager PLCGs (AE-PLCG) and simple evaluation tools as detailed in (Barnett, 2021).

## Structure

## Requirements
This project imports the following external modules, both of which can be attained using standard methods including `pip`: 
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)

This project also imports the following packages, which are generally pre-installed with Python:
- [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
- [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
